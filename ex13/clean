FIND(1)                   BSD General Commands Manual                  FIND(1)

NAME
     find -- walk a file hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
     find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression]
     find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] -f path [path ...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
     The find utility recursively descends the directory tree for each path
     listed, evaluating an expression (composed of the ``primaries'' and
     ``operands'' listed below) in terms of each file in the tree.

     The options are as follows:

     -E      Interpret regular expressions followed by -regex and -iregex pri-
             maries as extended (modern) regular expressions rather than basic
             regular expressions (BRE's).  The re_format(7) manual page fully
             describes both formats.

     -H      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link specified on the command line to be those
             of the file referenced by the link, not the link itself.  If the
             referenced file does not exist, the file information and type
             will be for the link itself.  File information of all symbolic
             links not on the command line is that of the link itself.

     -L      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link to be those of the file referenced by the
             link, not the link itself.  If the referenced file does not
             exist, the file information and type will be for the link itself.

             This option is equivalent to the deprecated -follow primary.

     -P      Cause the file information and file type (see stat(2)) returned
             for each symbolic link to be those of the link itself.  This is
             the default.

     -X      Permit find to be safely used in conjunction with xargs(1).  If a
             file name contains any of the delimiting characters used by
             xargs(1), a diagnostic message is displayed on standard error,
             and the file is skipped.  The delimiting characters include sin-
             gle (`` ' '') and double (`` " '') quotes, backslash (``\''),
             space, tab and newline characters.

             However, you may wish to consider the -print0 primary in conjunc-
             tion with ``xargs -0'' as an effective alternative.

     -d      Cause find to perform a depth-first traversal, i.e., directories
             are visited in post-order and all entries in a directory will be
             acted on before the directory itself.  By default, find visits
             directories in pre-order, i.e., before their contents.  Note, the
             default is not a breadth-first traversal.

             This option is equivalent to the -depth primary of IEEE Std
             1003.1-2001 (``POSIX.1'').  The -d option can be useful when find
             is used with cpio(1) to process files that are contained in
             directories with unusual permissions.  It ensures that you have
             write permission while you are placing files in a directory, then
             sets the directory's permissions as the last thing.

     -f      Specify a file hierarchy for find to traverse.  File hierarchies
             may also be specified as the operands immediately following the
             options.

     -s      Cause find to traverse the file hierarchies in lexicographical
             order, i.e., alphabetical order within each directory.  Note:
             `find -s' and `find | sort' may give different results.

     -x      Prevent find from descending into directories that have a device
             number different than that of the file from which the descent
             began.

             This option is equivalent to the deprecated -xdev primary.

PRIMARIES
     All primaries which take a numeric argument allow the number to be pre-
     ceded by a plus sign (``+'') or a minus sign (``-'').  A preceding plus
     sign means ``more than n'', a preceding minus sign means ``less than n''
     and neither means ``exactly n''.

     -Bmin n
             True if the difference between the time of a file's inode cre-
             ation and the time find was started, rounded up to the next full
             minute, is n minutes.

     -Bnewer file
             Same as -newerBm.

     -Btime n[smhdw]
             If no units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of a file's inode creation and the
             time find was started, rounded up to the next full 24-hour
             period, is n 24-hour periods.

             If units are specified, this primary evaluates to true if the
             difference between the time of a file's inode creation and the
